# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-EDA-
EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. The purpose of EDA is to understand the data and its underlying structure to generate insights, detect patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses. Hereâ€™s a typical outline for an introduction to EDA:

1. **Purpose of EDA**: Explain that EDA is used to gain a deeper understanding of data before formal modeling and hypothesis testing. It helps in making sense of the data, identifying relationships, and uncovering hidden insights.

2. **Key Techniques**: Mention some common techniques used in EDA:
   - Summary statistics: Mean, median, mode, range, variance, etc.
   - Visualization: Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.
   - Data cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, etc.
   - Data transformation: Normalization, standardization, etc.

3. **Steps Involved**:
   - **Data Collection**: Obtain the data from various sources.
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - **Data Visualization**: Create plots and graphs to visually represent the data.

4. **Benefits of EDA**: Discuss the advantages such as:
   - Understanding data distributions and patterns.
   - Identifying relationships between variables.
   - Checking assumptions required for statistical models.
   - Communicating insights effectively to stakeholders.
